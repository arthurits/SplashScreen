# Splash screen
A stand-alone splash screen used to launch other exe applications under Windows OS.

The main idea is totally  based on [Bradley Grainger's blog entry](https://faithlife.codes/blog/2008/09/displaying_a_splash_screen_with_c_introduction/ "Bradley's blog entry") posted back on September 22, 2008.
Shortly after, Stefan Olson built Bradleyâ€™s code (incorporating a few improvements) into a new Visual C++ application and shared it in a blog post on November 27. Unfortunately, his post is no longer available, although it can be retrieved using WayBackMachine [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20081212164733/http://olsonsoft.com/blogs/stefanolson/post/A-better-WPF-splash-screen.aspx "Archived Stefan's blog entry").

This project continues Bradley's and Stefan's efforts incorporating some minor tweaks:
* Splash image, application to be launched and fadeout time are all retrieved from an external plain text file. It could be easily adapted to JSON files if a JSON parser (such as [rapidJSON](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson "rapidJSON GitHub")) is included. 
* The splash screen is closed during the fadeout whenever the launched application is closed (the WM_QUIT message posted from the launched application is handled by the splash screen).
* The C++ version is ported to assembly (for the smallest and fastest possible splash screen executable) and some basic OOP is implemented.

## MASM x86 version
Requires masm32 SDK
Currently functional. Minor adjustments needed.

## MASM x64 version
Currently functional. Minor adjustments needed.

## C++ version
Minor tweaks to Bradley's and Stefan's original
Currently functional. Minor adjustments needed.

## Instructions
1. Set the splash screen application icon in the corresponding resources.rc file and then compile any of the 3 versions.
2. Create a text file with three lines:
   * Path (either absolute or relative) of the splash image. Should be less than 256 characters long
   * Path (either absolute or relative) of application to be launched. Should be less than 256 characters long
   * Time in miliseconds for the fading out of the splash screen
3. Use this code in the form's shown event to signal the fading out of the splash screen:
```
private void Form1_Shown(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // signal the native process (that launched us) to close the splash screen
    using (var closeSplashEvent = new EventWaitHandle(false, EventResetMode.ManualReset, "CloseSplashScreenEvent"))
    {
        closeSplashEvent.Set();
    }
}
```
